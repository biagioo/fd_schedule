CLI project 

REQUIREMENTS
1.Provide a CLI

2.Your CLI application must provide access to data from a web page.

3.The data provided must go at least one level deep. A "level" is where a user can make a choice and then get detailed information about their choice. 

4.Your CLI application should not be too similiar to the Ruby final projects (Music Library CLI, Tic-Tac-Toe with AI, Student Scraper). 
Also, please refrain from using Kickstarter as that was used for the scraping 'code along'.

5.Use good OO design patterns. You should be creating a collection of objects, not hashes, to store your data. 
Pro Tip: Avoid scraping data more than once per web page - utilize objects you have already created. It will speed up your program!
