# FdSchedule

Welcome! I've created a program that scrapes the schedule for the 2020 Formula Drift season. When running the program, it greets the user and displays the names of all upcoming events. It then asks the user which round they would like more information about. Then displays more information about the chosen round. It then give the user the options to see the schedule again, pick a round to learn more about or to type in exit to exit the program. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fd_schedule'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fd_schedule

## Usage

Once installed, simply enter ./bin/fd_schedule in your terminal and follow the porgrams instructions.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
